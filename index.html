<h1>Hieroglyphic encoding (RES) in web pages using JavaScript</h1>

This package offers an elegant framework for rendering hieroglyphic in web pages,
using JavaScript. Other technologies used are HTML5 Canvas and TrueType.
No server-side computation is involved.
<p>
One can use RES or RESlite. Rendering of RESlite is fast, but
requires compilation from RES, for instance using <a
href="http://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/egyptian/align">PhilologEg</a>.
RES is easier to use and more powerful, but can be slow to render for 
web pages that include large amounts of hieroglyphic text.
<p>
This package includes:
<ul>
<li> <a href="testsuite_lite.html">test suite for RESlite</a>
<li> <a href="testsuite_res.html">test suite for RES</a>
<li> <a href="skeleton_lite.html">skeleton of web page with RESlite only</a>
<li> <a href="skeleton_res.html">skeleton of web page with RES/RESlite</a> 
</ul>

<h2>Download and instructions for use</h2>

<ol>
<li> Download: <a href="resjs.tar">resjs.tar</a> (approx. 950KB).
<li> Unpack it. 
<li> To use RESlite only, one can create new web pages on the basis of
<a href="skeleton_lite.html">skeleton_lite.html</a>. 
One needs to include with the web pages
all the files ending on <tt>.ttf</tt> and <tt>.css</tt>,
as well as <tt>res_aux.js</tt>,  <tt>res_lite.js</tt>,  <tt>res_web.js</tt>.
<li> To use any RES/RESlite encodings, one can create new web pages on the
basis of <a href="skeleton_res.html">skeleton_res.html</a>.
One needs to include with the web pages 
all the files ending on <tt>.ttf</tt>, <tt>.js</tt>, and <tt>.css</tt>.
</ol>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<b>For which browsers is this intended?</b>
<p>
<i>In principle this should run on all modern browsers. So far it has been
tested on Chromium 34, Firefox 28, Rekonq 2.4.2.</i> 
<p>
<b>Why don't you use SVG?</b>
<p>
<i>We tried it, using both Raphael and Snap. In both cases the
path intersection operation that we need for the implementation of e.g. 
<b>insert</b> is far too slow to be useable in practice.
A rendered HTML5 Canvas is not scalable, but the rendering process is parameterizable
by a font size, so we don't see this as a problem for most web applications.</i>
<p>
<b>Who can use this software?</b>
<p>
<i>Anyone can use, modify and redistribute the JavaScript any way they like.
Acknowledgements where appropriate will of course be appreciated.

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li> Rendering of cartouches is poor in Firefox 28. This is due to an
aberrant 'feature' of clip().
</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

This JavaScript package builds upon a Senior Honours project 
by Alexander Michael Field, described in the unpublished report
<i>A Web Editor for Hieroglyphic</i>, 4 April 2014, University of St Andrews. 
This used SVG instead of Canvas.
